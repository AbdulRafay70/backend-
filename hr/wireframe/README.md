# HR Wireframe Prototype

Quick static prototype for HR pages. Files are located in `hr/wireframe/` and are plain HTML/CSS/JS so you can open them directly in your browser.

How to use
- Open `index.html` in a browser to jump to pages.
- Or open any page directly: `employee_profile.html`, `employees_list.html`, `attendance_dashboard.html`, `movements.html`, `commissions.html`.
- The prototype includes a small `wireframe.js` that adds a navigation bar, a modal dialog, and simulates a few button actions (Mark Paid, Start Movement, Check In, etc.).

Notes
- This is a static prototype for design/demo only. The JS simulates interactions; no data is saved.
- If you want, I can make the prototype a single-page demo or wire it up to JSON fixtures next.
# Employee Profile Wireframe

Files:
- `employee_profile.html` — static HTML wireframe for Employee Profile page
- `styles.css` — styling for the wireframe

How to view:
1. Open `d:/projects/git folder/All/backend/hr/wireframe/employee_profile.html` in your browser.
2. The page is static and does not call backend APIs; it is intended as a visual, interactive (tabs) prototype.

Notes:
- This is a static Figma-style wireframe for quick validation of layout and UX. Use it as a reference for implementing React components.
