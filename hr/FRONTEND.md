From the search menu, the user can filter by date, specific employee, or any status.
The Reset button should show all employees’ attendance data for today by removing all filters.
This page is for viewing the attendance of all employees.

Remove the “Add Movement” button.
The user should be able to search a specific employee by ID, name, or phone number.
In the Action column, add two actions:
Start Movement


End Movement


When clicking Start Movement, it should only ask for the reason.
 It should NOT ask for time or date — the system will automatically use the current PKT date and time.
 After entering the reason, the movement will start for that employee.
When clicking “End Movement,” the ongoing movement will automatically record the current PKT date and time and then end. Before closing the movement, a confirmation message should appear: “Are you sure you want to close this movement? Yes or No.” If the user selects “Yes,” the movement will end instantly.
Also add a Reset button and add more filters if possible.


Remove the “Add Commission” button from this page.
All earned commissions should be shown here — for all employees, for one specific employee, or filtered by other options.
Display:
All earned commissions


Redeemed commissions


Commissions added to the employee’s account


A Reset button should be available to clear all filters and show the default commission data.
This page will show only the commissions.
 If a user is logged in with an employee ID, they should only see their own commissions.
 Only users logged in with branch IDs can see all employees’ commissions.
All data on this page will be shown automatically from the bookings’ earned commissions.



Remove the “Add Record” button.
Allow filtering by a specific employee ID or by all employees, along with all other filters you added here.
If an employee is logged in with an employee ID, they should see only their own records — not any other employee’s records.
 Only branch accounts can see all employees’ records.
All records should be managed automatically.
Add a Reset button for clearing filters, and include all possible filters that can be added here.




If an employee logs in to this page, they can check in and can start their movement. 
This page will be the main dashboard for the employee after login.
Start Movement:
 The same options as previously discussed will be available.
check-in/check-out
When clicking Check In, the system will automatically verify the check-in time — whether it’s on time, before time, within grace period, or late — using the Pakistan Standard Time (PKT) date and time. This data is pulled automatically from the times set during employee creation or from the office’s check-in/check-out schedule.

After clicking Check In, the button will change to Check Out. If the employee tries to check out before the designated time, they need approval from the admin or branch manager to leave early.
The Add Commission button should be removed.
All other tabs like Salary, Commission, Attendance, Punctuality, and Movement will work for the logged-in employee but will only show their own data — no data from other employees.
In the Salary tab, the employee can see if there was any salary increment, whether the current month’s salary has been deposited or not, and the exact date and time of the salary deposit into their account.
